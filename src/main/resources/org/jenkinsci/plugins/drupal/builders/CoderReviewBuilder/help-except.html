<div>
  <p>Specify modules/themes that should not be reviewed, relative to the Drupal root directory.</p>
  <p>For instance if the Drupal root is 'drupal' and if you want to review only custom code then you might want to exclude contributed projects:
    <pre>
    drupal/sites/all/modules/contrib/**,
    drupal/sites/all/themes/contrib/**,
    drupal/modules/**,
    drupal/themes/**,
    drupal/profiles/**
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>This field supports <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">FileSet includes</a>.</p>

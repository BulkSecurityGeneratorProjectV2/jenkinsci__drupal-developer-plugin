  Specify modules/themes that should not be reviewed. For instance, if you want to review only custom code and skip contributed projects, you might want to set something like this:
  <pre>
    sites/all/modules/contrib/**,
    sites/all/themes/contrib/**,
    modules/**,
    themes/**,
    profiles/**
  </pre>
